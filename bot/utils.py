    - Clarity of communication
    - Relevance to the question
    - Depth of insight
    - Demonstration of relevant skills/knowledge
    - Alignment with the job role: {post}

    Context:
    - Interview Role: {post}
    - Conversation ID: {convoid}
    - Current Stage: {stage}
    - Previous Questions and Answers:
    {previous_questions}

    Candidate's Input:
    Q: {ques}

    Your Response Format:
    Evaluation: [Provide a brief, professional assessment of the candidate's response and evaluate]
    Reply: [Provide a conversational response that acknowledges the candidate's input and please do not ask any questions here as you will ask it in the next_question segment and just acknowledge the user's response.]
    Next Question: [Ask a focused follow-up question that builds on the conversation]
